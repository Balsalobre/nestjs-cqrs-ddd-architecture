# NestJS CQRS + DDD Example 🚀

This repository demonstrates how to implement Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) using NestJS. 🎯 The project showcases best practices for building scalable, maintainable, and modular applications with a focus on clean architecture principles. 🛠️

## Features:

    📦 Domain-Driven Design: Clear separation of concerns with well-defined domains and entities.
    🔄 CQRS: Efficiently handles commands and queries with event-driven patterns.
    ⚡ Event Sourcing (optional): Easily extendable to store the state as a series of events.
    📚 Vertical Slice Architecture: Modular organization for better scalability and testability.

Perfect for developers looking to learn or apply advanced architectural patterns in NestJS applications! 🚀
